# Where to Write Code

## I Know You Skipped my Intro, and I'm Sad
Welcome to the new page! I know I know, kind of ridiculous. But not everyone starts in the same spot. Some people will just skip the juicy intro that I worked
really hard on so that they can make 2 minutes of progress. I know many people will just stick to the basic script of everything, but I want to feel really
connected to my audience, you know? Speaking of which, have you had enough water today? Enough to eat? Take a break real quick, you deserve it.

## Repl.it
Ok spearheaded Computer Science specialists, I know. There are other tools out there, they are 'so much better' in your eyes, thank you for your humble opinion.
Repl.it is super easy, and super simple. Wanna start writing code? Follow these steps:

1. Go to https://repl.it/
2. Create an account. Simple, easy, fantastic, you're doing great.
3. Congratulations, now you have a place to write code.

Notice something, by the way. You didn't have to download anything! That's the power of cloud computing! Wanna learn about that? Regardless, someone else will
say yes, and I will make a section on it. 

## Ok, But How do I WRITE Code on Here?
You know what, that's a good question. Here are the steps for that:

1. Click the "+ New Repl" button. It should be in the top left
2. You'll get a pop-up window that asks for a `Language` and a `Name'.
3. This entire repo is dedicated to the `Python` computer language, so select that one
4. Name the Repl whatever you want!
5. Click 'Create Repl'

You'll be redirected to a page that looks a lot like this:

Congrats, you're ready to write code! There is one more section in here about `programming languages` which is optional, but VERY MUCH recommended for a better
understanding of what the hell you're doing. Either check it out, or move on. Whichever one suits you best.
