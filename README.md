# Cameron's Python Examples

## Welcome to Python Code Examples!

This GitHub repo is here to teach you some of the simple concepts about coding in one of the simpler programming languages: Python! Throughout this GitHub repository, you will find some great resources on how to code, including various skills that may *not* JUST be coding.

That's right, coding develops other skills. In fact, a lot of being a programmer is not about learning a coding language. It's about being a *problem solver*. And a lot of the time, it's not *other people's* problems you will be solving, but your own. Code almost never works as intended when you first run it. It's important that you learn some essential skills along the way that will help you in solving such issues--they happen far too often to be ignored.

To start off, here are some great reasons to start coding, from various sources:

#### The Muse:
###### (Source: https://www.themuse.com/advice/4-major-reasons-you-need-coding-skills-even-if-you-dont-want-to-be-an-engineer)
1. It will make you more self-sufficient
2. It will teach you how to think
3. It will improve your communication and collaboration skills
4. It can take your career to new heights

#### Medium:
###### (Source: https://medium.com/better-programming/here-are-5-great-reasons-why-you-should-learn-to-code-9e496cf82026)
1. You can turn an idea into an app
2. Programs keep your mind busy and active for life
3. Coding teaches you how to approach problem solving
4. Automate daily tasks and save time
5. Job security and a great salary
6. It's a fun hobby!
7. A vibrant and friendly community *(I'd debate this one. StackOverflow can be toxic and gatekeepers are all over the place, don't let it get to you!)*

#### My reasoning (This is in no particular order):
###### (Source: Me.)
1. The world has gone digital, it's time you start speaking the langauge
2. Understanding the *non-scifi* capabilities of code will help you better understand your own security and privacy online
3. Improve your logic skills like crazy
4. Someone captured electricity in a rock and with code, you can control that electricity. How cool is that?
5. You can brag to your friends that you know how to code *(Although please don't)*
6. You can learn to use the Terminal/cmd, and look like a hacker, without even hacking!
7. Learning to code is extremely rewarding! You'll feel so much happiness when you get each program to work.
8. I'm making it nice and easy--baby steps!
9. Your grandparents would be proud
10. If you read all these points, it's very obvious that you're invested enough to at least start. What are you waiting for???


As you can see, there is plenty to look forward to, so start exploring! This repo is a work-in-progress. If it doesn't look complete or comprehensive yet, that's because it isn't yet. Keep an eye out for updates!
