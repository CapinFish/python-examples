# Introduction

So, you want to learn how to code? Well, I know reading is really boring. I want to keep things really simple, use a lot of pictures, and a lot of examples.
I also like using very casual language, because humans don't usually talk in terms like "Honorificabilitudinitatibus" and other English "syntactic sugar".
I mean really, who cares? Let's cut the chit-chat and get right to business.

## "I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START"... Ok, How About here?
```python
# Let's say something fun
print('chicken nugget')
# Wow, I bet that does something cool!
```

I bet that's absolutely terrifying to look at, right? Like, what the hell does any of that mean? This is where you don't start. You're new to this, it's
far too soon to throw you into the ocean yet. Let's slow it down and talk about some simple stuff first; really make sure to ease you into the new world
you just entered. It's kind of like at the end of Captain America: The First Avenger where Steve Rogers is in the middle of a crazy futuristic New York.
I'm Nick Fury right now, you're Steve Rogers. Don't worry, pal. I'll get you up to date in no time.

## Where to Start: Understanding Coding
What in God's name is coding? It's pretty simple, let's give you a great example here. Imagine you only speak one language. It really doesn't matter
*which* language it is, and I would rather leave it abstract. Otherwise, I'd get poor ratings on Twitter for not being inclusive enough. So let's say you
have to travel to a different country for some business, but they speak a completely different language than you. It's really hard to communicate with them,
isn't it? You're doing all these hand gestures to try and describe what any of your words mean. Now ironically, that's very similar to how we tell our computer
how to do things. You speak a language, you translate your language into these simple (and awkward) hand gestures that both you and the other person (the computer)
can understand.

As a human, you say 'hi' simply by opening your mouth and saying it. A computer says something like this: `print('hi')`. There are some details that I am definitely
saving for later because they don't matter right now. If you're a really smart Computer Science nerd with years of experience, please stop fuming. We'll get to it.

Of course, humans kind of have it easy. When you want to talk to another human, you can do it whenever the hell you want. You are on Earth, you have the privilege
of walking outside, finding a person, and saying 'hi' to them. That's pretty cool! You know what you can't do, though? You can't just write code anywhere. Let's
try it, just for fun.

As you can see, not a single damn computer listened to me. That line of code is sitting there, doing absolutely nothing for society other than wasting a precious
piece of paper. So what did we learn from this?

## Where to Write Code: A Beginners Approach
There are some great places to write code where you'll never have to worry about the pesky details on how to set up a project, or virtual environment, or any
mumbo jumbo that you can just learn later. You're here to learn to code, not manage a file system. I understand. If you want to learn more about the setup process,
there will be a section on it in here at some point, I can assure you of that. Remind me to come back and edit this part with a link to that part of the repo once
it's added. But for those of us who just want to get to coding, we're going to use an online "IDE" ('Integrated Development Environment' but again, details for later)
called repl.it. This is a fantastic site to start coding right away with nothing holding you back. For ease of visibility in this repo, I'll start a new section for
setting up the site. See you there!
